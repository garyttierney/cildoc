# cildoc

cildoc is a JavaDoc / Doxygen style documentation generator for the SELinux
Common Intermediate Language.  The aim is to produce browsable documentation
for all aspects of a CIL source policy (and improve the documentation style
of the policy API, which Tresys Technology have already worked on.)
